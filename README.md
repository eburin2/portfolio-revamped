# Portfolio Project (April 2018)

## Brief Description

This project's purpose is to utilize and display an array of CSS techniques to build a personal portfolio while also showcasing some of my work from the last six months.  

##Projects

Sunlight Supply Controller Page - For this project, I was instructed to code the layout for each specific tab on the controller page using LESS, HTML, and RAZOR.     

Sunlight Supply Custom Lighting - For this page, I was instructed to omit the single image that was being used for the page and create a carousel effect with a variety of images that were given to me using javascript, HTML, and CSS.

Wax-Cathedral - My capstone project using vue.js, CSS, and HTML that allows a user to sift through a single profile page and filter music albums based on the album title,  artist name, year released, origin from which the album came from, and the album rating. This project is still in a nascent stage.

Pro-ject Debut Carbon -  An independent project that showcases a product for sale, a Project-Debut Turntable,  which implements the use of HTML and CSS.  I recently added bootstrap to the project to better the responsiveness.
